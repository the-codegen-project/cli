## Terminal Command Execution

- **Use bash wrapper for reliable command execution** due to zsh/powerlevel10k compatibility issues in Cursor
  - Template: `bash -c "{command here}"`
  - Ensures proper output capture and exit code handling
  - Prevents issues with p10k prompt interference

- **Command Wrapping Examples:**
  ```bash
  # :white_check_mark: DO: Use bash wrapper
  bash -c "npm test"
  bash -c "yarn build"
  bash -c "git status"
  
  # :x: DON'T: Direct zsh execution (may fail in Cursor)
  npm test
  yarn build
  git status
  ```

- **Benefits of bash wrapper:**
  - Consistent output formatting
  - Reliable exit code propagation
  - Avoids p10k theme rendering conflicts
  - Ensures compatibility across different terminal environments

- **When to apply:**
  - All terminal commands executed through Cursor
  - Automated scripts and build processes
  - Git operations and package manager commands
  - Any command where output capture is critical
