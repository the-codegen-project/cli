# Configurations

There are 3 possible configuration file types, `json`, `esm` (JavaScript), and `yaml`.

The only difference between them is what they enable you to do. The difference is `callbacks`, in a few places, you might want to provide a callback to control certain behavior in the generation library.

For example, with the [`custom`](./generators/custom.md) generator, you provide a callback to render something, this is not possible if your configuration file is either `json` or `yaml` format.

Reason those two exist, is because adding a `.js` configuration file to a Java project, might confuse developers, and if you dont need to take advantage of the customization features that require callback, it will probably be better to use one of the other two.
